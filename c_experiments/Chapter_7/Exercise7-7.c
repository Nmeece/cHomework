/*
*    Prime numbers can also be generated by an alorithm known as the Sieve of Erastosthenes.
*    The algorithm for this procedure is presented here. Write a program that implements this
*    algorithm. Have teh program find all prime numbers up to n = 150. What can you say about
*    this algorithm as compared to ones used in the text for calculating prime numbers?
*
*    Sieve of Erastosthenes Algorithm
*    To Display All Prime Numbers Between 1 and n
*
*    Step 1: Define an arry of integers P. Set all elements P[i] to   0,2 <= i <= n
*    Step 2: Set i to 2.
*    Step 3: If  i > n , the algorithm terminates.
*    Step 4: If P[i] is 0, then i is prime.
*    Step 5: For all positive integer values of j, such that i x j <= n, set P[ixj] to 1.
*    Step 6: Add 1 to i and go to step 3.
