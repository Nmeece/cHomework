/*
 * 5. The criteria used for termination of the loop in the squareRoot()
 * function of Program 7.8 is not suitable for use when computing the square
 * root of very large or very small numbers. Rather than comparing the
 * difference between the value of x and the value of guess2, the program
 * should compare the ratio of the two values to 1. The closer this ratio gets
 * to 1, the more accurate the approximation of the square root.
 * Modify Program 7.8 so this new termination criteria is used.
